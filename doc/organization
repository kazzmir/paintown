Organization for games:
  Any directory in data/games would be considered a complete game

  data/games/paintown
  
  or

  data/games/whatever

  The root directory will still be 'data' so all paths will be in the form of
    'games/whatever/blah'

  Generic stuff can stay in the 'data' directory like fonts and whatnot. Games can
  also have their own versions of any common directory
    games/whatever/fonts
    games/whatever/menu

  Question: when paintown starts up how will it know which game to select? Maybe
  do something like quake where you choose a mod. To change to a different game
  there will be a menu selection that lists all the games available.
