Future
-------
* network versus play
done * use joystick
* fix bug with setting max lives
* separate z planes for each block
100% * level lighting. lamps/objects can make the level brighter as the user gets close to them
* infinite enemy mode like in super smash brothers
* breakable inanimate objects like boxes and trash cans
* RPG mode???
* allow level to go left or right
* tutorial mode
* allow characters to run
* allow characters to block
* give enemies 'behaviors' which model how they act
* make network mode use versions
10% * allow level sets to only allow explicit players
90% * make a console like in quake where debug output can go
* port to psp/nds
maybe done? * network players need their health/name drawn in front of background stuff
* allow more characters in the network host boxes (like '-')
DONE * make "Loading Paintown" text configurable
* make credits screen configurable
* triggers during the level. send arbitrary s-expressions to objects/anything
  (trigger (to (object 2)) (message (increase health 20)))
* bitmaps should be able to swap themselves out on demand. if memory is constrained then save to disk or completely unload some bitmaps. when those bitmaps need to be used again reload them. this can be done for sounds as well.
* turn around animations. when a character is facing left and turns right, instead of just instantly facing right there should be a "turn" animation in between.

mugen
-----
* mugen sound system
  - turn MugenSound objects collected from .snd file into something useable 
    within paintown's sound system 
* mugen main system
  - load in menus
    Select Screens:
	80% - Character select - Need to add in support for modes and teams
	20% - Team Character select
	DONE - Allow to be used independently from menu
    - Option Menu (To an extent.... Mainly rely on paintowns system)
    90% - Storyboards - Needs correction, mainly due to background issues...
    50% - load in fight.def info from mugen for the stage mechanics (i.e. Round indicators, 
    Round Ticker, Players Health and Power bars) etc.
    DONE - Menuing system utilize paintowns menus to render itself and its options
    DONE - Each submenu subclass MenuOption to produce the arcade/versus/demo etc
* mugen stages in paintown
  - correct camera y movement
  DONE - correct camera x movement
  DONE - correct character placement
  - replace vs mode with mugen stages
* mugen characters in paintown
  - replace (attack (x y w h)) with (attack (box x y w h) (box x y w h)) to support
    multiple attack boxes. clearing attack boxes will consist of (attack).
  - create a new MugenCharacter (either extends Character or ObjectAttack) to deal 
    with mugen things like state.
  - Replicate Finite State Machine
    - Expressions lexer
  - Correct shadow CMYK (stage related?)
* mugen backgrounds in paintown
  DONE - correct tiling of elements
  - correct parallax
  - correct background controllers
  - correct trans effects
* mugen config and txt files
  50% - parse data using peg
    100% - peg generator in python
    95% - def parser
    50% - air parser
    50% - cns parser
    50% - cmd parser
* mugen sff files
  - Correct issues with loading certain files like (High/Low) Resolution images and their palettes
  - Support sffv2 format

For 3.3
-------
done * finish lamp lighting
90% * make console useable
50% * parse mugen files
40% * implement at least partially working mugen
