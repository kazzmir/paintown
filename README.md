## Get Source

If you are reading this you might already have the source. If not get it from the
[Paintown Repository](https://github.com/kazzmir/paintown).

Additional data which has collections of characters, levels and other items can be obtained in the [Paintown Data Repository](https://github.com/kazzmir/paintown-data).
```
Note to distribution maintainers it is recommended to omit the data from the above repository since it may contain copyrighted material.
The included data in the Paintown Repository should be sufficient for running the application (which excludes levels and content).
```

You can build paintown with [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com) using the Makefile.

### Linux
##### Build Debug
```
$ make
# To build tests do:
$ make test
```

##### Cross-compile for windows with mingw
```
$ make mingw
# To build tests do:

```
> *Note this build depends on x86_64-w64-mingw32 and hasn't been tested on any other distro than debian based ones*

### Ubuntu
There are several scripts that will install the necessary packages and then invoke the compilation
#### Basic build
`
$ ./easy-compile-ubuntu
`
#### Mingw build (cross compilation for windows)
`
$ ./easy-compile-mingw
`
> Binaries are dumped into the mingw-bin directory. Make sure you copy zlib1.dll with your binary.

### Fedora
