Get Source:

	If you are reading this you might already have the source. If not get it from here
	Game engine: $ svn co https://paintown.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/paintown/trunk
	Data: $ svn co https://paintown.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/paintown/data

	You need the svn program, which is part of subversion, http://subversion.tigris.org/. Put the data directory inside the trunk directory, trunk/data.

Compilation:

	You can use scons or cmake. If you have scons installed type

	$ scons

	If you are on windows and have visual studio and mingw but would rather
	use mingw type

	$ scons env=mingw

	Or you can use cmake

	paintown $ md b
	paintown $ cd b
	paintown/b $ cmakesetup ..
	paintown/b $ make

	The executable will end up in bin/paintown.exe

	To build a statically linked binary give the 'static' target
	$ scons static

Install:
	$ ./install.sh -d <data> -b <bin>

	Copy the data directory to <data> and put a script in <bin>.
	Default <data> directory is /usr/share/games/paintown
	Default <bin> directory is /usr/games

	The script will prompt you to input these directories if you do not
	give -d and/or -b.
