# MUGEN Go port

## Current authorization

Implementation is authorized. The user approved `docs/PLAN.md` and authorized
local commits at each milestone or coherent checkpoint. Record findings,
validation, and remaining work with each checkpoint. Stage/commit only changes
under `game/mugen/`; preserve unrelated work and never push without instruction.

## Scope

All project changes for this effort belong under `game/mugen/`. Do not modify
the root Go module, other engines, or existing data trees. Keep working notes,
compatibility evidence, and handoffs in `docs/`.

## Compatibility target

Target Elecbyte M.U.G.E.N 1.1 beta 1. The local reference distribution is
`temp/mugen-1.1b1/`: use its `docs/`, `data/`, `chars/`, and `stages/` as the
primary specification and regression corpus. The C++ implementation in
`src/mugen/` is useful prior art, but is incomplete and is not the specification.
Do not modify the reference distribution. Do not commit its binaries/assets.

## Implementation and verification

- A registered controller or a successfully parsed file does not demonstrate
  behavioral compatibility. Track partial and missing behavior honestly.
- Prefer deterministic, display-independent tests for expression and state
  semantics. Add corpus tests for the bundled stock content and malformed files.
- Errors must identify the file/state/controller/expression. Never treat an
  unknown controller or invalid trigger as a successful no-op.
- Exercise the complete selection-to-fight path as well as test applications.
- Run native captures, app smoke captures and audio probes sequentially on the
  private display/audio server. Overlapping windows can invalidate OpenGL
  captures, and other audio output invalidates tone provenance. Pure tests
  without DISPLAY may run alongside those probes.
- Run Go with `GOFLAGS=-mod=readonly` so the root module stays unchanged. Build
  artifacts and disposable tools belong in `temp/`, which is not source.
- Use the launcher or `-modfile=game/mugen/mugen.mod` for the scoped dependency
  overlay; see `docs/BUILD.md`. Keep it synchronized when dependencies change.
- Use non-Go extensions for disposable source snapshots. The recursive check
  also discovers ordinary packages below `temp/`; ignored files still compile.
- Full race checks use `--check -race -timeout=20m`; the growing native Match
  corpus approaches Go's default ten-minute package deadline.
- Update `docs/COMPATIBILITY.md` and `docs/HANDOFF.md` when behavior or verified
  coverage changes. Do not call the port complete without tests and reference
  evidence covering the advertised compatibility.
